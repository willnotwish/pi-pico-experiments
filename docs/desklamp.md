## Why is my desk LED lamp flickering?

I think it's the power supply. I don't think it's the original unit supplied with the lamp.

I connected a liner PSU (Farnell) to investigate. The central pin on the connector is positive. It seems to work best at a supply voltage of ~18V.

I am thinking of combining the desk lamp with the LED strip. The LED strip needs 12V (maybe +-0.5V adjustment).

_Maybe I can design a PSU to power both lamps from a single mains input._
