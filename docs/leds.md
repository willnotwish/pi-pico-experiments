## 5050 LEDs

I have a bunch of these RGB LEDs to experiment with.

They are SMD devices, with 6 pins. A bit tricky to solder, maybe.

The datasheet doesn't say which colour is which pin, as far as I can tell. Also, the red LED is different from the other two, in terms of electrical characteristics.

For red, forward voltage should be in the range 1.8 - 2.4V. For G & B it's 2.8 - 3.6V

20mA seems to be the maximum current.

So I'll need different series resistors for R & G/B.
